      Analyze the content, style, interests, and values expressed in their posts to build this persona.
      
      Focus on identifying:
      1. Personality traits (e.g., analytical, creative, empathetic)
      2. Communication style (e.g., direct, humorous, formal)
      3. Values and beliefs (e.g., values authenticity, environmental consciousness)
      4. Interests and activities (e.g., technology, cooking, hiking)
      5. Lifestyle indicators (e.g., urban professional, outdoor enthusiast)

      {
        "name": "Their name (if available, otherwise 'Unknown User')",
        "handle": "Their X handle (without the @ symbol)",
        "bio": "A concise 1-2 sentence description of who they are",

      The traits should represent personality characteristics, communication style, and values.
      The interests should be specific topics, activities, or areas they seem interested in.
      Be specific and precise in your analysis. Base your assessment purely on the provided data.
      
      If there isn't enough information to determine specific traits or interests, make educated guesses
      based on the limited information available, but keep them reasonable and grounded.
